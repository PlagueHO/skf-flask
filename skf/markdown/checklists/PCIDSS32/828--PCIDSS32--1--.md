9.4 Implement procedures to identify and 
authorize visitors. 

Procedures should include the following: 

 9.4 Verify that visitor authorization and access controls are in 
place as follows: 

Visitor controls are important to reduce the ability 
of unauthorized and malicious persons to gain 
access to facilities (and potentially, to cardholder 
data). 

Visitor controls ensure visitors are identifiable as 
visitors so personnel can monitor their activities, 
and that their access is restricted to just the 
duration of their legitimate visit. 

Ensuring that visitor badges are returned upon 
expiry or completion of the visit prevents malicious 
persons from using a previously authorized pass to 
gain physical access into the building after the visit 
has ended. 

A visitor log documenting minimum information on 
the visitor is easy and inexpensive to maintain and 
will assist in identifying physical access to a 
building or room, and potential access to 
cardholder data.
