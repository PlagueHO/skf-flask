1.3.7 Do not disclose private IP 
addresses and routing information to 
unauthorized parties. 

Note: Methods to obscure IP addressing 
may include, but are not limited to: 

. Network Address Translation 
(NAT) 
. Placing servers containing 
cardholder data behind proxy 
servers/firewalls, 
. Removal or filtering of route 
advertisements for private 
networks that employ registered 
addressing, 
. Internal use of RFC1918 address 
space instead of registered 
addresses.
